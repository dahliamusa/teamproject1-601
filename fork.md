# Fork

A **fork** is a copy of a repository that functions as an 
independent project separate from the original.

There is no explicit fork command in the terminal, but you 
can easily fork a repository in GitHub by opening the repository 
of the project you would like to fork and clicking the "Fork" button.

You will then see the forked repository in your own account.

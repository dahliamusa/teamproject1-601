# Fork

A **forked** repository is a copy that is used as a central repository. 
There is no command specifically for forking because to create the 
forked repository, you just copy a different one and for that we can 
use *clone*. The difference between fork and clone, however, is 
that when a repository is forked, it becomes a project separate from 
the original. The commits that happen here are usually not *pushed* 
back to the original. In a clone, the original repository usually still 
serves as the central repository for the project.

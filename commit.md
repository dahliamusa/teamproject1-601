# Commit

A **commit** is a snapshot of your repository, usually after the project has 
been modified. Commits include metadata, such as what content has been modified, 
any notes from the author, who the author is, and a timestamp. When you commit, 
you are essentially saving and documenting your changes. The purpose of commits 
is to create a history of a [repository](/repo.md) so that the progress of a project can 
be easily tracked and reviewed. Thus, it is important to commit frequently.

To commit, use the 'git commit' command.

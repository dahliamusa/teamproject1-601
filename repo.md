# Repository

A **repository**, also called a repo, is a directory where files for a 
certain project are stored. When working on a project, it is common to 
have local and remote repositories. A local repository is saved to your 
local machine, and it is where you would do your individual work. A remote 
repository is the common repository containing the combined work of all 
contributors. When you have any completed code segments in your local repository, 
you would send your work to the remote repository, or [push](/push.md) it, 
so that it can be added to the remote repository. Services like GitHub 
are usually used to manage remote repositories.

The 'git innit' command is used to create a local respository. If you are going 
to start working on an existing project, however, you likely won't be creating a 
new respository locally. Instead, you would create a local copy of a remote repository, 
and to do this, you will need to use the 'git clone' command. For more information 
on cloning a repository, check out the [clone](/clone.md) page.

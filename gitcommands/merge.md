# Merge

**Merge** will join multiple [branches](/gitcommands/branch.md) or sequences of 
commits into a single branch, creating one unified history. The 
target for the merge is always the [checked out](/gitcommands/checkout.md) branch.

To merge, first make sure you have checked out the right branch.

Then, use the `git merge` command followed by the name of the branch to 
merge.

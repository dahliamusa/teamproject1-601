# Clone

When a repository is **cloned**, it is copied, with all its files 
and commits, to a new location. Cloning is used to copy a remote 
repository to a local machine. Cloning is usually done once at the 
beginning of your interaction with a project. After the remote repository 
is cloned, you can work on the project locally and then [push](/gitcommands/push.md) 
your changes back to the remote repository.

To clone a repository, get the URL of the repository from GitHub
and enter the command `git clone` followed by the URL.

# Remote

The **remote** command allows users to manage connections to remote repositories. There are three remote commands that are often used, remote show, remote add, and remote remove. 

## Remote Show
The command `git remote show` shows the URLs of the remote repositories when listing your current remote connection. It can also be shorthanded by the command `git remote -v`.

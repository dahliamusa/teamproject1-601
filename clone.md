# Clone

When a repository is **cloned**, it is copied, with all its files 
and commits, to a new location. Cloning is often used to copy a 
remote repository to a local machine. After the remote repository 
is cloned, you can work on the project locally and then *push* 
your changes back to the remote repository.

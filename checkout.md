# Checkout

A **checkout** is a very useful command that works for three major components: files, commits, and branches. While it is useful for checking out commits and files, it is primarily used to checkout branches to allow the user to navigate between branches. A critical component of checking out a branch is that it updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, while also recording all new commits on that branch. When using git checkout for branches, there are three major functionalities that can be performed: creating branches, switching branches, and checking out remote branches by using the command `git checkout`.
